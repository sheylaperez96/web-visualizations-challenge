# Unit 14 Homework: Belly Button Biodiversity

In this assignment, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. 

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Checkout the page here: https://sheylaperez96.github.io/web-visualizations-challenge/

## Instructions
- Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
- Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

## Final Results
